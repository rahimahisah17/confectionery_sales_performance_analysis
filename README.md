## 📖 Project Description
This project is a comprehensive 3-page interactive Power BI suite designed to analyze and optimize confectionery sales performance. Moving beyond basic visualization, the report addresses critical business pillars: **Sales & Demand Trends**, **Operational Efficiency**, and **Regional Intelligence**.

Using a dataset of **$1.89M in total revenue**, I developed over **50 custom DAX measures** to track KPIs like Average Order Value (AOV), Year-over-Year growth, and revenue concentration. The report features a "Sakinah" (orderly) user interface, utilizing advanced **Bookmarks and Buttons** to provide a seamless, app-like navigation experience.

## 🎯 Business Tasks & Solutions
I structured the analysis to solve the following requirements:
* **Sales Health:** Tracking total sales/volumes over time and calculating **Average Order Value (AOV)** to understand transaction quality.
* **Operational Optimization:** Analyzing channel performance and identifying products with declining trends for proactive intervention.
* **Regional Intelligence:** Mapping geographic performance and identifying revenue concentration among top customers to mitigate risk.

## 💡 Strategic Insights Drawn
* **Financials:** Total Revenue of **$1.89M** with an AOV of **$248.24**. **Chocolate Truffles** and **Nougat** are the primary revenue anchors.
* **Operations:** Maintained a strong **95.2% Order Completion Rate**, though items like **Marshmallows** require immediate review due to negative MoM growth.
* **Geography:** The **West Region** is the strongest performer, significantly outperforming the Midwest and Northeast territories.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Advanced DAX:** Authored 50+ custom formulas for dynamic ranking, time intelligence (YoY/MoM), and complex aggregations.
* **UI/UX Design:** Built a highly interactive workspace using custom **Buttons and Bookmarks** for navigation.
* **Data Modeling:** Optimized a **Star Schema** to ensure high performance across multi-dimensional filters.

## 🔍 Strategic Business Insights & Recommendations

Based on the 3-page diagnostic analysis, several high-impact insights were identified to drive profitability and operational efficiency:

### **1. Revenue Concentration & Portfolio Risk**
* **The Anchor Effect:** Analysis reveals that the **Total Revenue of $1.89M** is heavily anchored by two primary products: **Chocolate Truffles** and **Nougat**. 
* **Business Risk:** Over-reliance on these two items poses a strategic risk if supply chain disruptions occur or market preferences shift. 
* **Recommendation:** Diversify revenue by cross-selling underperforming lines to the high-volume Wholesale segment to balance the product mix.

### **2. Regional Performance & Market Penetration**
* **Western Powerhouse:** The **West Region** is the clear market leader, significantly outperforming the Midwest and Northeast. This is driven by a high concentration of **Distributor** accounts which yield a superior revenue-per-order ratio.
* **Opportunity Gap:** The **Northeast** shows the lowest market penetration despite having a high population density. 
* **Recommendation:** Reallocate a portion of the marketing budget from the saturated West to the Northeast to test localized growth strategies.

### **3. Transaction Quality & AOV Optimization**
* **Profitability Leakage:** While the **Average Order Value (AOV) stands at $248.24**, transaction quality fluctuates significantly across sales channels.
* **Channel Sensitivity:** The **Online** channel drives frequency but suffers from lower AOVs compared to **Wholesale**.
* **Recommendation:** Implement tiered pricing or "free shipping" thresholds for online orders to push the AOV closer to the $300 mark.

### **4. Predictive Growth Trends**
* **Negative Growth Warning:** Specific product lines, including **Marshmallows**, have entered a period of negative **Month-over-Month (MoM) growth**. 
* **Early Intervention:** This decline often precedes a permanent drop in market share if left unaddressed. 
* **Recommendation:** Bundle declining items with top-sellers (e.g., a "Confectionery Favorites" pack) to liquidate aging inventory while maintaining margins.
